# Data

This folder contains the data files needed to run the Streamlit app.

The areas_20XX.npz files are dictionaries where each key is a string containing a date and location, and the values are the number of pixels in each poppy patch.

The centroids_lat_long.npz file is a dictionary where each key is a string containing a date and location, and the values are the latitudes and longitudes of each poppy patch. The keys in the centroids dictionary match the keys in the areas dictionaries.
