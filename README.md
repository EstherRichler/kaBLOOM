# kaBLOOM


The kaBLOOM app uses satellite imagery to find poppy blooms. For this proof-of-concept demo I used data from the 2017-2020 poppy seasons (March-April) at three California locations. This repository contains the code I used to create the kaBLOOM app. The 'notebooks' folder has Jupyter notebooks containing the eda and analysis code, and also has a demo notebook with an abridged version of the analysis pipeline; the 'scripts' folder has the Python code that I used to create the app in Streamlit; and the 'data' folder has the processed data needed for use in the app. I did not upload the raw satellite data because it is quite large, but I included the code I used to get and process the data from the Sentinel hub.

The app can be accessed [here](http://35.164.63.227:8501).
